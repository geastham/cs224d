#CS224D - Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing
This is a working project repository for assignments / explorations associated with Stanford University's [cs224d](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/) course. Please see the website for more information and project background.

I've chosen to implement this project using the Scala / Spark ecosystem with the following project dependencies:
  * Scala 2.10.5
  * [TensorFlow](http://www.tensorflow.org) Java API 1.0

## Quick Setup

 1. Install [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)
 1. Clone this project
 1. Run `sbt` (This will also download all dependencies)
